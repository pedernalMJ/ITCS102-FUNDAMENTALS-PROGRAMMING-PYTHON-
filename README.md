- Activity 2: Getting user input and combining it with output using f-strings. [activity2.py](activity2.py)
- Activity 3: Formatting text with escape characters (\n, \t, \\, \"). [activity3.py](activity3.py)
- Activity 4: Counting the number of characters in a string with len(). [activity4.py](activity4.py)
- Activity 5: Identifying the data type of a value using type(). [activity5.py](activity5.py)
- Activity 6: Performing basic arithmetic operations in Python. [activity6.py](activity6.py)
- Activity 7: Using assignment operators to update variable values. [activity7.py](activity7.py)
- Activity 8: Comparing values with comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=). [activity8.py](activity8.py)
- Activity 9: Combining conditions using logical operators (and, or, not). [activity9.py](activity9.py)
- Activity 10: The use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) in Python. [activity10.py](activity10.py)
- Activity 11: Continuation of the use of conditional stament(exercises). [activity11.py](activity11.py)
- Activity 12: Introduction to for loop (start,stop,step). [activity12.py](activity12.py)
- Activity 13: Compute the sum of 10 user-inputted numbers using a for loop. [activity13.py](activity13.py)                        
-Activity 14: Display numbers from 20 down to 1 using a reverse for loop. activity14.py
-Activity 15: Input 10 numbers and find the sum of all odd numbers. activity15.py
-Activity 16: Print numbers from 1 to 10 in a single line. activity16.py
-Activity 17: Display a number grid (1â€“10) using nested loops. activity17.py
-Activity 18: Print a right-angled triangle of numbers using nested loops. activity18.py
-Activity 19: Display a right-angled triangle pattern using *. activity19.py
-Activity 20: Display an inverted right-angled triangle pattern using *. activity20.py
